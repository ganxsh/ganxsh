# About Me

Hi there! I'm a CSE Student with a passion for creating and building innovative solutions. I have experience in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, and am always looking to learn and expand my skills.

I have a strong background in full-stack web development, with a focus on using modern technologies and best practices. I have experience working with Python, Java, C++ and Lua, as well as frameworks such as React, Angular and Vue.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also a prodect team member and AIS(Bennett University), with the ability to work well in both collaborative and independent environments.

If you're interested in working together or just want to chat about technology and development, don't hesitate to reach out!
